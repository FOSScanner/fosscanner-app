# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Real document scanning: automatic edge detection (OpenCV via
  `opencv_dart`) with a draggable corner overlay to correct it, then
  perspective correction into a flat, upright page.
- Scan filters — Original, Auto-Enhance, Grayscale, Black & White — with
  live thumbnail previews before confirming.
- Re-edit a page's corners/filter after the fact without re-scanning it.

### Fixed

- A native double-free in the edge-detection pipeline (disposing
  individual `findContours` result elements instead of the container they
  came from) that could crash the app on capture, most reliably on
  realistic (multi-megapixel) photos. See `CLAUDE.md` for details.

### Known limitations

- Edge detection, perspective correction, and filters are native-only
  (`opencv_dart` has no web support); the web build falls back to using
  the raw captured photo as-is.
- The release APK grew from ~49.5MB to ~83.7MB from the bundled OpenCV
  native libraries.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Capture document pages with the device camera.
- Combine captured pages into a single PDF.
- Share the generated PDF via the OS share sheet, or download it directly
  on web when the Web Share API isn't available.
- Material 3 UI that follows the system's light/dark theme.

### Privacy

- Captured photos and generated PDFs are never persisted by the app:
  temp files are deleted as soon as a page is removed, the list is cleared,
  the app closes, or right after handing the PDF off to the share sheet.
