## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Capture document pages with the device camera.
- Combine captured pages into a single PDF.
- Share the generated PDF via the OS share sheet, or download it directly
  on web when the Web Share API isn't available.
- Material 3 UI that follows the system's light/dark theme.

### Privacy

- Captured photos and generated PDFs are never persisted by the app:
  temp files are deleted as soon as a page is removed, the list is cleared,
  the app closes, or right after handing the PDF off to the share sheet.
